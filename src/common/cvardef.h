/***
cvar_t variables are used to hold scalar or string variables that can be changed
or displayed at the console or prog code as well as accessed directly
in C code.

The user can access cvars from the console in three ways:
r_draworder prints the current value
r_draworder 0 sets the current value to 0
set r_draworder 0 as above, but creates the cvar if not present

Cvars are restricted from having the same names as commands to keep this
interface from being ambiguous.

The are also occasionally used to communicated information between different
modules of the program
